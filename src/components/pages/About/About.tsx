							Why are we developing a chatbot for the HWR Berlin?
						</p><br></br>
						<p>
							Artificial intelligence (AI) has developed significantly in recent years and has become accessible to a wider range of people. Chatbots in particular have established themselves as important tools in various areas. Chatbots offer the potential to optimize work processes and facilitate access to information.
						</p><br></br>
						<p>
							The ability to understand and respond to natural language is a key success factor for modern chatbots. The progress that natural language processing (NLP) has made in recent years has been largely made possible by large amounts of data and powerful algorithms such as neural networks.
						</p><br></br>
						<p>
							In order to reduce the workload of the study program service at the HWR Berlin, the advantages of chatbots are also to be used at the university and therefore one will be implemented to answer inquiries from international prospective students. The aim is to significantly reduce the number of email inquiries to the study program service and at the same time create an efficient and user-friendly source of information for prospective students.
						</p><br></br>
						<p>
							The implementation of this project was placed in the hands of students as part of study projects. As a result, the project team involved changes every one or two semesters.
